0. Reload your data, and re-use the code you already have for getting things formatted nicely (columns renamed, factors relabeled, etc.)

```{r}

```

1. Aggregate (e.g., get mean/median/max/something) of some numerical variable, over one or more factors.  Use `group_by()` plus `summarize()` from the `dplyr` package. You may or may not need to reshape the data first!

```{r}

```

2. Get your data into "long" (aka "tidy") format, if it isn't already

```{r}

```
