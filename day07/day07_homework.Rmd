Find three relationships in your data.  For each relationship, do the following:

1. Verbally articulate the relationship you want to examine with a plot.

2. Verbally identify what variables you want to map to each graphical dimension.

3. Reshape your data as needed.

```{r}

```

4. Use ggplot2 to create your graphs.

```{r}

```

5. Fiddle with colors, axis labels, themes, etc. until the plot looks "publication ready" to you.  Try to change at least one thing per plot.

```{r}

```

6. Save all plots to a format that you could use in a paper.  HINT: PNG works well for pasting into Word documents.

```{r}

```
