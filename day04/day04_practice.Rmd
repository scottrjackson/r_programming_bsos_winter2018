1. What are the four primary/basic data types in R?
   - Practice creating a vector of each data type
   - Using c(), concatenate pairs of these vectors together
   - What happens?  What data types are coerced to what?

```{r}


```

2. Make a copy of the `iris` data frame
  - Using `sample()` pull the data apart into two random batches
  - Put the pieces back together with `rbind()`
  - Put the pieces back together with `bind_rows()` from the `dplyr` package, creating an ID that keeps track of which piece is which
  
  
```{r}


```

3. Make a copy of the `iris` data frame
  - using [ , ] notation, pull the data frame into two sets of different columns
  - Put the pieces back together with `cbind()`
  - Put the pieces back together with `bind_cols()` from the `dplyr` package

```{r}


```

4. Run the following code to create a new small data frame with some additional information about iris species

```{r}
iris.info <- data.frame(Plant = c("setosa", "virginica", "limniris"),
                        State = c("Alaska", "Tennessee", "Louisiana"),
                        Rating = c(1, 5, 15))
```

Now merge this information with the `iris` data to create a new data frame. Using the `merge()` function, experiment with all = TRUE and all = FALSE. Also experiment with the `dplyr` join functions:
  - `inner_join()`
  - `full_join()`
  - `left_join()`
  - `right_join()`
  - `semi_join()`
  - `anti_join()`
  
```{r}

```
