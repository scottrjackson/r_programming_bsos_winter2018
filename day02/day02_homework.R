# 1. Read your data set into R

# 2. Peek at the top few rows

# 3. Peek at the top few rows for only a few columns

# 4. How many rows does your data have?

# 5. Get a summary for every column

# 6. Get a summary for one column

# 7. Are any of the columns giving you unexpected values?

# 8. Select a few key columns, make a vector of the column names

# 9. Create a new data.frame with just that subset of columns

# 10. Create a new data.frame that is just the first 10 rows
#     and the last 10 rows of the data from the previous step

# 11. Create a new data.frame that is a random sample of half of the rows.
# HINT: ?sample

# 12. Find a comparison in your data that is interesting to make
#     (comparing two sets of numbers)
#     - run a t.test for that comparison
#     - decide whether you need a non-default test
#       (e.g., Student's, paired)
#     - run the t.test with BOTH the formula and "vector"
#       formats, if possible
#     - if one is NOT possible, say why you can't do it

# 13. Repeat #12 for TWO more comparisons
#     - ALTERNATIVELY, if correlations are more interesting,
#       do those instead of t-tests (and try both Spearman and
#       Pearson correlations)
#     - Tip: it's okay if the comparisons are kind of nonsensical, this is 
#       just a programming exercise

# 14. Save all results from #12 and #13 in an .RData file

# 15. Email me your version of this script, PLUS the .RData
#     file from #14
#     - ALTERNATIVELY, push your version of this script and your .RData results
#       to a repo on GitHub, and send me the link
